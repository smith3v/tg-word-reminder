# Memory Techniques in Anki: Spaced Repetition and the SM-2 Algorithm

## Overview of Spaced Repetition

*Memory retention plummets without review – a phenomenon charted by Ebbinghaus’* *forgetting curve* *(red). Spaced repetition counters this by scheduling reviews just before you’d forget, resetting the curve and reinforcing memory each time.*

Human memory follows a predictable forgetting curve: soon after learning something new, recall drops off steeply unless we review the material[\[1\]](https://bubblyprofessor.com/2020/02/19/spaced-repetition-conquer-the-curve-of-forgetting/#:~:text=Ebbinghaus%20also%20noticed%20that%20with,%E2%80%9D)[\[2\]](https://www.growthengineering.co.uk/spaced-repetition/#:~:text=The%20key%20to%20spaced%20repetition,intervals%20as%20your%20memory%20strengthens). Spaced repetition is a learning technique that **staggers reviews over increasing intervals** to combat this natural forgetting. Initially, a fact or word is reviewed after a short delay (when it’s “foggy but not gone”[\[1\]](https://bubblyprofessor.com/2020/02/19/spaced-repetition-conquer-the-curve-of-forgetting/#:~:text=Ebbinghaus%20also%20noticed%20that%20with,%E2%80%9D)). Each successful recall allows the next interval to be longer, because **repeated exposure slows the rate of forgetting**[\[1\]](https://bubblyprofessor.com/2020/02/19/spaced-repetition-conquer-the-curve-of-forgetting/#:~:text=Ebbinghaus%20also%20noticed%20that%20with,%E2%80%9D). In essence, the system aims to show you an item *right before you would have forgotten it*, which maximizes retention while minimizing unnecessary reviews[\[2\]](https://www.growthengineering.co.uk/spaced-repetition/#:~:text=The%20key%20to%20spaced%20repetition,intervals%20as%20your%20memory%20strengthens). Over time, well-learned items might be reviewed only after months or years, while new or difficult items are reviewed more frequently. This approach has been proven far more effective for long-term retention than cramming, because each spaced **active recall** strengthens memory and prolongs how long you can remember the item[\[3\]](https://www.growthengineering.co.uk/spaced-repetition/#:~:text=Spaced%20repetition%2C%20on%20the%20other,it%20from%20fading%20over%20time)[\[4\]](https://bubblyprofessor.com/2020/02/19/spaced-repetition-conquer-the-curve-of-forgetting/#:~:text=The%20goal%20of%20spaced%20repetition,a%20bit%20longer%20to%20fade).

## The SM-2 Spaced Repetition Algorithm (Step-by-Step)

One of the earliest and most influential scheduling methods for spaced repetition is the **SuperMemo SM-2 algorithm**, devised by Piotr Wozniak in 1987\. Anki’s original scheduling system is based on SM-2’s logic. SM-2 introduced the idea of assigning each flashcard an **easiness factor** (“E-Factor”) that determines how quickly its review intervals grow[\[5\]](https://super-memory.com/english/ol/sm2.htm#:~:text=E,Factor), and adjusting that factor based on your recall quality. Below is a step-by-step breakdown of how the SM-2 algorithm works:

1. **Initial Setup:** When a new item is learned, it is given an initial Ease Factor of **2.5** (or 250%)[\[5\]](https://super-memory.com/english/ol/sm2.htm#:~:text=E,Factor). This E-Factor reflects how easy that item *currently* is for you – higher means you can wait longer between reviews. All items start at the default (2.5) until proven otherwise. You also associate a repetition count (or review stage) with the item, initially 0 since it hasn’t been successfully recalled yet.

2. **First Reviews (Fixed Intervals):** SM-2 specifies the first two intervals explicitly. When you review an item for the first time *and recall it correctly*, the next review is scheduled **1 day** later. Upon the second successful recall, the next interval jumps to **6 days**[\[6\]](https://super-memory.com/english/ol/sm2.htm#:~:text=,Factor%20of%20a%20given%20item). These short initial intervals help solidify the memory. After these two steps, the intervals will grow multiplicatively as described next.

3. **Quality Rating (Recall Feedback):** After each review, you provide a **quality rating** for your recall on a **0–5 scale**[\[7\]](https://super-memory.com/english/ol/sm2.htm#:~:text=,of%20the%20recently%20repeated%20item). This is how you tell the algorithm *how well* you remembered:

4. 5 \= perfect recall (no hesitation)[\[7\]](https://super-memory.com/english/ol/sm2.htm#:~:text=,of%20the%20recently%20repeated%20item)

5. 4 \= correct, with minor hesitation

6. 3 \= correct, but difficult recall (you struggled)

7. 2 \= incorrect, but you *almost* remembered upon seeing the answer

8. 1 \= incorrect, *you remembered the answer once it was shown*

9. 0 \= complete blackout (no recollection at all)[\[8\]](https://super-memory.com/english/ol/sm2.htm#:~:text=grade%20scale%3A%20,of%20the%20recently%20repeated%20item)

In SM-2, any rating **3 or above is considered a successful recall**, and ratings 0–2 mean you failed to recall the item[\[9\]](https://super-memory.com/english/ol/sm2.htm#:~:text=%3E%20%20q%20,repeat%20again%20all%20items%20that). This feedback drives the scheduling adjustments: easy recalls push the item further out, while failures or tough recalls bring it closer.

1. **Adjusting the Ease Factor:** If you remembered the item (quality ≥ 3), SM-2 updates the item’s Ease Factor *before* scheduling the next interval. The adjustment is done with a specific formula:

$$ \*\*EF' := EF \+ \\big(0.1 \- (5 \- q)\\\*(0.08 \+ (5 \- q)\\\*0.02)\\big)\*\*, $$

where **q** is the 0–5 quality rating you gave[\[10\]](https://super-memory.com/english/ol/sm2.htm#:~:text=,3). This looks complex, but it boils down to a few intuitive effects: \- If you answered **perfectly (5)**, the term becomes 0.1 – 0 \= \+0.1, so the E-Factor increases by \+0.1 (i.e. \+10 percentage points)[\[11\]](https://super-memory.com/english/ol/sm2.htm#:~:text=%3E%20EF%27%3A%3DEF). The card gets a bit “easier,” meaning future intervals will be longer.
\- If you answered **“good” (4)**, the term is 0.1 – 1*(0.08+0.02) \= 0.1 – 0.10 \= 0.0. So* *q=4 leaves EF unchanged* *(no change in difficulty)[\[11\]](https://super-memory.com/english/ol/sm2.htm#:~:text=%3E%20EF%27%3A%3DEF).*
*\- If you answered* *“hard” (3), the term is 0.1 – 2*(0.08+0.04) \= 0.1 – 2\*0.12 \= –0.14, so EF decreases by 0.14 (i.e. –14 points). The card is deemed harder, so future intervals will grow more slowly[\[11\]](https://super-memory.com/english/ol/sm2.htm#:~:text=%3E%20EF%27%3A%3DEF).

In short, the better you remember an item, the higher its ease factor goes; the more you struggle, the more the ease factor falls[\[11\]](https://super-memory.com/english/ol/sm2.htm#:~:text=%3E%20EF%27%3A%3DEF). This per-card factor personalizes the spacing to item difficulty – easy items might end up with EF close to 2.6 or 2.7 over time, while very hard items might drop to the minimum allowed. **Importantly, SM-2 enforces a minimum EF of 1.3** (130%)[\[12\]](https://super-memory.com/english/ol/sm2.htm#:~:text=Shortly%20after%20the%20first%20SuperMemo,Factors%20for%20items%20was)[\[13\]](https://super-memory.com/english/ol/sm2.htm#:~:text=%3E%20%20EF%27%20,then%20start%20repetitions%20for%20the). This prevents intervals from shrinking too much; an EF below 1.3 would make reviews annoyingly frequent and was found to be counterproductive[\[12\]](https://super-memory.com/english/ol/sm2.htm#:~:text=Shortly%20after%20the%20first%20SuperMemo,Factors%20for%20items%20was). In practice, most items stabilize somewhere between 1.3 and 2.5 EF depending on how often you remember them easily.

1. **Scheduling the Next Interval:** After updating the ease factor (for successful recalls), the algorithm determines the next review date (the new interval). The rule is: **next interval \= last interval × EF** (rounded up to the nearest whole day)[\[6\]](https://super-memory.com/english/ol/sm2.htm#:~:text=,Factor%20of%20a%20given%20item). However, for the first few reviews we use the special cases:

2. If this was the **first successful review** (i.e. the item was new or just reset), set interval \= **1 day**[\[14\]](https://super-memory.com/english/ol/sm2.htm#:~:text=,Factor%20of%20a%20given%20item).

3. If it was the **second** consecutive successful review, set interval \= **6 days**[\[14\]](https://super-memory.com/english/ol/sm2.htm#:~:text=,Factor%20of%20a%20given%20item).

4. From the **third review onward**, multiply the previous interval by the current Ease Factor to get the next interval[\[6\]](https://super-memory.com/english/ol/sm2.htm#:~:text=,Factor%20of%20a%20given%20item). (Always round up to at least 1 day longer than the last interval[\[15\]](https://faqs.ankiweb.net/what-spaced-repetition-algorithm#:~:text=When%20using%20SM,longer%20than%20the%20previous%20interval).)

For example, suppose you had a card on a 6-day interval. If its current EF is 2.5 and you mark it “Good” (quality 4), the next interval will be *6 × 2.5 \= 15 days* (approximately)[\[16\]](https://forums.ankiweb.net/t/sm-2-algorithm-pseudo-code/8350#:~:text=Basically%3A%20,read%20the%20source%20code%20directly). If another card is on a 6-day interval but has a lower EF of 1.5 (because it’s been hard for you), and you just barely remembered it (quality 3), the EF might drop to \~1.36 and the next interval becomes *6 × 1.36 ≈ 8 days*. Over time, an easy card’s interval grows exponentially (multiplying by \~2.5 each time), whereas a difficult card’s interval grows more slowly. This process ensures each item is reviewed at the optimal time for *its* difficulty[\[2\]](https://www.growthengineering.co.uk/spaced-repetition/#:~:text=The%20key%20to%20spaced%20repetition,intervals%20as%20your%20memory%20strengthens). (Most SM-2 implementations also ensure that intervals never decrease or repeat – each new interval will be at least one day longer than the previous, even if the math would suggest otherwise[\[15\]](https://faqs.ankiweb.net/what-spaced-repetition-algorithm#:~:text=When%20using%20SM,longer%20than%20the%20previous%20interval).)

1. **Handling Forgotten Items (Lapses):** If your recall **failed (quality \< 3\)**, SM-2 treats the item as if it were new again. In the original SM-2 specification, *you do not change the Ease Factor on a failure* – you keep the same EF as before[\[9\]](https://super-memory.com/english/ol/sm2.htm#:~:text=%3E%20%20q%20,repeat%20again%20all%20items%20that). (The logic is that a single lapse might be a fluke or due to early learning, and shouldn’t always make the item permanently “harder.”) However, you **reset the repetition count and schedule**. This means the item’s next interval goes back to the first step: **1 day** (or whatever your I(1) is)[\[9\]](https://super-memory.com/english/ol/sm2.htm#:~:text=%3E%20%20q%20,repeat%20again%20all%20items%20that). Essentially, the card will start the cycle over: after the lapse you’ll review it in 1 day, then 6 days, etc., until it catches up again. In an implementation, you might set the card’s interval to 1 day and its repetition count to 0 (or 1\) to denote that it’s back to square one for scheduling purposes.

2. **Immediate Repetition of Difficult Items:** Original SM-2 includes an extra review loop for lapses and low scores: after each day’s review session, **any item that scored below 4** (meaning you failed it or found it hard) should be reviewed *again* in that same session[\[17\]](https://super-memory.com/english/ol/sm2.htm#:~:text=,items%20score%20at%20least%20four). You keep repeating those troublesome items (potentially with a few minutes’ gap) until each is recalled with a score of at least 4 (good recall). This guarantees that before you finish studying, you’ve re-learned the items you forgot or barely remembered. In effect, you’re drilling the lapses immediately so that you *leave the session on a successful recall*[\[17\]](https://super-memory.com/english/ol/sm2.htm#:~:text=,items%20score%20at%20least%20four). This immediate feedback loop is important for cementing memories: if you got a card wrong, you see it again right away (or a few minutes later) until you get it right, and *then* it’s put back into the longer-term schedule.

The above steps summarize the core of SM-2. In pseudocode, the review algorithm can be represented like this (combining steps 3–6):

\# Assume each card has: ease\_factor (EF), current\_interval (days), repetition\_count.
\# repetition\_count \= 0 for new cards (no successful reviews yet).

function reviewCard(card, quality):
    if quality \< 3:  \# Answered incorrectly (0-2)
        card.repetition\_count \= 0          \# reset repetition count (start over)
        card.current\_interval \= 1          \# schedule again in 1 day (first interval)
        \# EF is not changed on a lapse in original SM-2\[9\]
    else:
        if card.repetition\_count \== 0:     \# first successful review
            card.current\_interval \= 1      \# 1 day interval
        elif card.repetition\_count \== 1:   \# second successful review
            card.current\_interval \= 6      \# 6 days interval
        else:
            \# multiply last interval by Ease Factor for subsequent reviews
            card.current\_interval \= ceil(card.current\_interval \* card.ease\_factor)
        \# Update Ease Factor based on quality (q)
        card.ease\_factor \= card.ease\_factor
                         \+ (0.1 \- (5 \- quality) \* (0.08 \+ (5 \- quality) \* 0.02))
        if card.ease\_factor \< 1.3:
            card.ease\_factor \= 1.3         \# enforce minimum EF of 1.3\[13\]
        card.repetition\_count \+= 1         \# increment successful repetition count

For a developer implementing this: each card needs to store its **ease factor** and **current interval** (or next due date) at minimum, as well as some indicator of how many times it’s been reviewed (to know when to apply the 1-day and 6-day rules). In practice, after each review you’d use the above logic to update the card’s EF and interval. If the card was marked incorrect, you’d reset its interval and potentially do an immediate relearning review (step 7\) after a short delay (e.g. a few minutes or the end of the session). The power of this algorithm is that over time each card’s schedule becomes tuned to your memory of that item – easy items naturally get big intervals and bother you less, while tough items keep showing up until you truly learn them.

## How Anki Calculates and Adjusts Intervals

The SM-2 algorithm produces **exponentially increasing intervals** for remembered items. After the initial 1d and 6d reviews, each subsequent interval is roughly *EF times the previous*. If you consistently mark an item “Good” (4) and keep an EF around 2.5, the intervals might progress roughly like: 1 day, 6 days, \~15 days, \~38 days, \~95 days, and so on – quickly reaching months and then years. On the other hand, if an item’s EF has dropped closer to 1.5 due to struggles, its growth is slower: 1 day, 6 days, \~9 days, \~14 days, \~21 days, etc. This adaptive scheduling implements the **spacing effect**: each review strengthens the memory, so the next interval can be longer[\[4\]](https://bubblyprofessor.com/2020/02/19/spaced-repetition-conquer-the-curve-of-forgetting/#:~:text=The%20goal%20of%20spaced%20repetition,a%20bit%20longer%20to%20fade). Crucially, intervals are always rounded up to whole days (no fractions)[\[18\]](https://super-memory.com/english/ol/sm2.htm#:~:text=,5%20grade%20scale), and most systems ensure a new interval is *at least 1 day longer* than the last to avoid non-sensical decreases[\[15\]](https://faqs.ankiweb.net/what-spaced-repetition-algorithm#:~:text=When%20using%20SM,longer%20than%20the%20previous%20interval).

Modern spaced repetition software (including Anki) often adds a bit of **random variation** to interval calculation as well. For example, Anki introduces a small random ±% “fuzz” to the computed interval[\[19\]](https://help.remnote.com/en/articles/6026144-the-anki-sm-2-spaced-repetition-algorithm#:~:text=setting%20to%20make%20all%20intervals,wider%20or%20narrower%20than%20default). This prevents a situation where many cards that were learned on the same day always come due together. By staggering them slightly, reviews are more evenly distributed and cards don’t become unintentionally “grouped” (which could make them easier or harder than normal if reviewed back-to-back). The random adjustment is minor (typically on the order of ±5% or so of the interval) and doesn’t violate the algorithm’s overall spacing strategy – it’s just a practical tweak for real-world scheduling.

**Late reviews** are another factor: if you review a card *after* it was scheduled (say you were supposed to review it yesterday but forgot), Anki’s algorithm will often give you a bit of an *interval boost* for having remembered it despite the extra delay[\[20\]](https://faqs.ankiweb.net/what-spaced-repetition-algorithm#:~:text=,in%20answering%20but%20still%20remembered). In effect, the software says “you went X days over the due date and still remembered – perhaps we can schedule a little further out next time.” Concretely, Anki adds a bonus to the current interval proportional to how late you are, especially if you rate the card Good or Easy[\[21\]](https://help.remnote.com/en/articles/6026144-the-anki-sm-2-spaced-repetition-algorithm#:~:text=The%20Interval%20Factor%20is%20then,and%201%20for%20Easily%20Recalled). This means the next interval will be slightly extended to account for your demonstrated retention. (If you were late and forgot the card, of course it lapses and restarts as usual.)

In summary, interval calculation in SM-2 (and Anki) boils down to multiplying the previous interval by a factor. That factor is primarily the card’s ease factor (EF), but in modern usage it can be modified by the specific rating button pressed (e.g. Hard vs Good vs Easy have different effects, see below), by an “interval modifier” setting (a user preference to make all intervals longer/shorter globally), and by adjustments for late reviews or randomness. The goal is to fine-tune the next review timing so that it lands when you’ll *barely* remember the item – the sweet spot for reinforcing memory[\[2\]](https://www.growthengineering.co.uk/spaced-repetition/#:~:text=The%20key%20to%20spaced%20repetition,intervals%20as%20your%20memory%20strengthens).

## Handling Forgotten Items in Practice

No matter how well the scheduling algorithm works, you will sometimes forget an item. How does the system handle these lapses? In SM-2, as described, a lapse (quality 2 or below) triggers an immediate reset of that item’s schedule: it goes back to an interval of 1 day (after you re-study it) and loses its progress. The Ease Factor was *not* immediately lowered on a lapse in the original formula[\[9\]](https://super-memory.com/english/ol/sm2.htm#:~:text=%3E%20%20q%20,repeat%20again%20all%20items%20that), but in later adaptations (including Anki) it often is. The philosophy is that if you’ve forgotten the card, it might have been scheduled too far out, so lowering the ease can shorten future intervals. However, there’s a balance to strike: too harsh a penalty and you’ll end up in “low interval hell” for that card (stuck reviewing it every day).

**Anki’s default approach to lapses** is a bit more nuanced: \- When you press **“Again” (fail)** on a review card in Anki, the card’s interval is set to **0** and it enters a **relearning phase**[\[22\]](https://faqs.ankiweb.net/what-spaced-repetition-algorithm#:~:text=,the%20card%20exits%20relearning%20mode). By default the card is treated like new: you’ll see it again after a very short delay (e.g. 10 minutes or whatever your first learning step is), then maybe again after some minutes or hours, before it gets back to a 1-day interval. This is analogous to SM-2’s recommendation to immediately relearn forgotten items[\[17\]](https://super-memory.com/english/ol/sm2.htm#:~:text=,items%20score%20at%20least%20four). The idea is to quickly re-establish the memory while it’s fresh. After those quick retries, the card will “graduate” again to normal scheduling. (Anki allows the user to configure these relearning steps – often a couple of short intervals on the same day for a lapse.) \- Anki **does reduce the ease factor** of the card when you fail it – by **20 percentage points** by default[\[22\]](https://faqs.ankiweb.net/what-spaced-repetition-algorithm#:~:text=,the%20card%20exits%20relearning%20mode). For example, if the card’s ease was 2.5 (250%), it becomes 2.3 (230%) after a lapse. This means once the card is back in the review phase, its intervals will be shorter than before, to give you a better chance at success. You can think of this as a gentle penalty to reflect that this card was harder than expected. (Notably, Anki only applies that penalty once per lapse cycle – if you fail the card multiple times in the process of relearning on the same day, it doesn’t keep dropping the ease further each time[\[23\]](https://faqs.ankiweb.net/what-spaced-repetition-algorithm#:~:text=,not%20influence%20a%20card%E2%80%99s%20ease). The ease factor won’t go below 130% in any case[\[15\]](https://faqs.ankiweb.net/what-spaced-repetition-algorithm#:~:text=When%20using%20SM,longer%20than%20the%20previous%20interval).) \- By default, Anki **resets the interval** of a lapsed card to 1 day (after relearning), similar to SM-2’s full reset. However, Anki users have the option to set a **“new interval” percentage** (in Deck Options) so that a lapsed card’s interval is only partially reduced instead of wiped out[\[24\]](https://faqs.ankiweb.net/what-spaced-repetition-algorithm#:~:text=%2A%20Like%20SM,instead%20of%20the%20same%20day)[\[25\]](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=34152100#:~:text=In%20anki%20%22Deck%20Options%20,it%27s%20easy%20the%20next%20time). For instance, if you set this to 50%, and you had a card at 100 days that you lapsed on, then after you re-learn it, the next interval will be 50 days (instead of 1 day). This is a compromise some prefer to avoid over-repeating content they mostly know. By default this option is 0% (full reset) in Anki, because the assumption is that if you forgot the card, it’s better to start over to ensure you truly fix the memory. But the option is there for a developer to consider if full resets seem too punitive.

In an SM-2-like implementation for a bot, you might keep it simple initially: if the user fails a word, set its interval back to 1 day (or even have them repeat it in a few minutes), and maybe reduce an internal “ease” rating for that word so that future intervals grow more slowly. The key is to not let forgotten items slip through – you show them again soon (spaced repetition turns into *spaced* learning for that item until it’s back in memory).

Another aspect of lapse handling is **not punishing early learning too much**. Anki treats the **learning phase** separately: when a card is still new or in relearning, pressing “Again” or “Hard” does **not** lower its future ease factor at all[\[26\]](https://faqs.ankiweb.net/what-spaced-repetition-algorithm#:~:text=New%20cards%20have%20no%20ease%2C,effect%20over%20the%20card%27s%20ease). The rationale is that initial learning is fickle – you might fail a new card a few times while you’re still encoding it, but that shouldn’t make the card permanently considered “hard.” Only after a card has graduated (i.e. you’ve gotten it right and it enters the long-term review schedule) does Anki start adjusting its ease factor based on your feedback[\[26\]](https://faqs.ankiweb.net/what-spaced-repetition-algorithm#:~:text=New%20cards%20have%20no%20ease%2C,effect%20over%20the%20card%27s%20ease)[\[23\]](https://faqs.ankiweb.net/what-spaced-repetition-algorithm#:~:text=,not%20influence%20a%20card%E2%80%99s%20ease). This is a protective measure to avoid the dreaded scenario where a card becomes so “leeched” that its EF drops to the minimum and you have to review it every day forever. In fact, Anki will *stop* lowering the ease factor if it gets too low and a card keeps failing – instead it might flag the card as a “leech” suggesting you reformulate the content. In your implementation, consider resetting or fixing a minimum ease to keep intervals sane[\[27\]](https://faqs.ankiweb.net/what-spaced-repetition-algorithm#:~:text=Limitations), and perhaps alerting the user if a word is failed, say, 5+ times (it might indicate a problem with that card’s phrasing or that it’s not worth memorizing).

**Summary:** Forgotten items are essentially recycled through the learning process again. The SM-2 algorithm resets their schedule, and modern tweaks like Anki’s will also adjust difficulty ratings to prevent immediate re-forgetting. The aim is to **re-enter the item into the spaced repetition cycle at an appropriate, shorter interval** so that you’ll hopefully recall it next time. By dynamically shortening or lengthening intervals based on performance, the system “self-corrects” for items that turned out harder or easier than expected.

## Modern Adaptations in Anki and Other Tools

The SM-2 algorithm has stood the test of time – it’s simple, effective, and forms the basis of many flashcard programs. However, **modern spaced repetition systems (SRS)** like Anki have introduced several adaptations and refinements to SM-2 to improve learning outcomes and user experience[\[28\]](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=34152100#:~:text=Most%20SRS%20algorithms%20seen%20in,in%20one%20shape%20or%20form). If you’re implementing your own version (e.g. in a Telegram bot), here are some key considerations and simplifications drawn from Anki and similar tools:

* **Dedicated Learning Phase:** Anki separates **learning (short-term repetition)** from **review (long-term spacing)**. Instead of immediately applying SM-2’s 1-day then 6-day schedule to a new word, Anki lets you define initial **learning steps** (for example: 10 minutes, then 1 day) for new cards[\[29\]](https://faqs.ankiweb.net/what-spaced-repetition-algorithm#:~:text=%2A%20SM,performance%20in%20the%20retaining%20stage). You might see a new word multiple times in one day until you get it right, without those “failures” penalizing the card’s ease factor[\[30\]](https://faqs.ankiweb.net/what-spaced-repetition-algorithm#:~:text=that%20it%20can%20be%20necessary,performance%20in%20the%20retaining%20stage)[\[23\]](https://faqs.ankiweb.net/what-spaced-repetition-algorithm#:~:text=,not%20influence%20a%20card%E2%80%99s%20ease). Only after you’ve answered it correctly through all the learning steps does the card “graduate” to the spaced review phase (starting with an interval of 1 day or whatever you set as the first review). This approach acknowledges that a few immediate errors are normal when first learning something, and it focuses the SM-2 algorithm on the retention stage *after* initial acquisition[\[29\]](https://faqs.ankiweb.net/what-spaced-repetition-algorithm#:~:text=%2A%20SM,performance%20in%20the%20retaining%20stage)[\[23\]](https://faqs.ankiweb.net/what-spaced-repetition-algorithm#:~:text=,not%20influence%20a%20card%E2%80%99s%20ease). In your bot, you might implement this by requiring, say, two consecutive correct recalls in one session before a word is considered learned and scheduled a day later.

* **Fewer Rating Options (Simplified Feedback):** The original SM-2 uses a 0–5 rating, but Anki simplifies this to **four choices** for reviews: **Again**, **Hard**, **Good**, and **Easy**[\[31\]](https://faqs.ankiweb.net/what-spaced-repetition-algorithm#:~:text=,simply%20varying%20the%20positive%20answers). These roughly map to quality 1 (Again \= fail), 3 (Hard \= barely remembered), 4 (Good \= normal correct), and 5 (Easy \= effortless) in SM-2 terms. The absence of 2 and 0 as separate buttons is because those are just different degrees of fail – Anki treats any fail the same for scheduling[\[31\]](https://faqs.ankiweb.net/what-spaced-repetition-algorithm#:~:text=,simply%20varying%20the%20positive%20answers). This UI simplification still captures the essential feedback (forgot, hard, good, easy) without overburdening the user with 6 choices. For your project, you could similarly use a smaller set of options or even just **“forgot” vs “remembered”** in a pinch. More granularity helps fine-tune the schedule, but even a binary correct/incorrect system (like the Leitner box method[\[32\]](https://www.growthengineering.co.uk/spaced-repetition/#:~:text=Image%3A%20Leitner%20system%20diagram)) can work with adjustments to interval lengths.

* **Hard and Easy Adjustments:** With four answer buttons, Anki implements specific behaviors for each:

* **Again (Fail):** as discussed, resets the card to relearning steps and lowers ease by 20 points[\[22\]](https://faqs.ankiweb.net/what-spaced-repetition-algorithm#:~:text=,the%20card%20exits%20relearning%20mode).

* **Hard:** the card was recalled, but with difficulty. Anki will schedule it sooner than normal – specifically, it uses a **Hard interval multiplier** (by default **1.2×** the last interval)[\[33\]](https://faqs.ankiweb.net/what-spaced-repetition-algorithm#:~:text=,2%20by%20default). So if the card was on 10 days, Hard might schedule it in \~12 days (instead of maybe 15–25 days if it were Good). The ease factor is also decreased by 15 points to make future intervals shorter[\[33\]](https://faqs.ankiweb.net/what-spaced-repetition-algorithm#:~:text=,2%20by%20default). This corresponds to giving a quality 3 in SM-2, but Anki handles it in a more constrained way (fixed % decreases rather than the formula).

* **Good:** this is the normal “OK” answer. The card’s next interval \= **current interval × ease factor** (just like SM-2)[\[34\]](https://faqs.ankiweb.net/what-spaced-repetition-algorithm#:~:text=,The%20ease%20is%20unchanged). The ease factor itself usually remains unchanged for Good (since it represents a moderate success). So if a card is at 20 days and EF 2.3, Good yields \~46 days next. Good is the default you’ll use most of the time.

* **Easy:** this means the card was *too* easy – you recalled it effortlessly. Anki will give it a bigger leap: next interval \= **current interval × ease factor × Easy Bonus**[\[35\]](https://faqs.ankiweb.net/what-spaced-repetition-algorithm#:~:text=,increased%20by%2015%20percentage%20points). The Easy Bonus is a user-set parameter (default 1.3, or \+30%). So if the card was at 20 days and EF 2.3, an Easy might yield \~20 × 2.3 × 1.3 ≈ 60+ days. It also **increases the card’s ease factor** by 15 points (e.g. 2.3 → 2.45)[\[35\]](https://faqs.ankiweb.net/what-spaced-repetition-algorithm#:~:text=,increased%20by%2015%20percentage%20points). This is a bit more aggressive than raw SM-2, rewarding you for knowing it cold[\[36\]](https://faqs.ankiweb.net/what-spaced-repetition-algorithm#:~:text=,2%20algorithm). In practice, you should use Easy sparingly – only when the card feels trivial – otherwise the intervals might grow too fast.

These fixed adjustments are a *simplification* of SM-2’s formula. They’re easier to communicate to users (e.g. “Hard \= 1.2× interval, Easy \= \+15% ease”) and avoid extreme changes. When implementing, you can adopt a similar scheme: define what each response does to the interval and ease. For example, you might say: Fail \-\> reset interval to 1 day, ease \-20; Hard \-\> interval ×1.5, ease \-10; Good \-\> interval × EF (no change in ease); Easy \-\> interval × EF × 1.3, ease \+10. The exact numbers can be tuned, but the concept is to have predictable outcomes for each rating. (Anki’s defaults were chosen based on experience with SM-2’s results.)

* **Interval Caps and Floor:** Anki (and SuperMemo) impose reasonable limits on scheduling parameters. As noted, the ease factor is kept \>= 1.3 (130%)[\[27\]](https://faqs.ankiweb.net/what-spaced-repetition-algorithm#:~:text=Limitations). Also, Anki lets you set a **maximum interval** (e.g. 365 days by default) so that no matter how easy a card gets, it will still come up at least once per year (you can change this). Such caps prevent cards from being postponed into oblivion on the assumption you’ll remember forever. Another subtle rule: Anki ensures that each new interval (except on a fail) is *at least 1 day greater* than the previous[\[15\]](https://faqs.ankiweb.net/what-spaced-repetition-algorithm#:~:text=When%20using%20SM,longer%20than%20the%20previous%20interval) – this prevents a Hard review from giving an interval shorter than what you had before (which could otherwise happen if your ease factor dropped a lot). In your implementation, consider enforcing these limits to avoid pathological cases. For instance, never let your multiplier (ease) drop below 1.3, and if a formula ever suggests an interval shorter than the prior one (or too ridiculously long), clamp it.

* **Delayed Review Bonus:** As mentioned earlier, Anki accounts for the situation where you review a card late but still remember it. The longer you managed to remember past the due date, the more it will extend the next interval to credit you[\[20\]](https://faqs.ankiweb.net/what-spaced-repetition-algorithm#:~:text=,in%20answering%20but%20still%20remembered). In Anki’s V3 scheduler, this is done by adding extra days to the interval before multiplying by ease – the formula uses *days late / some divisor* based on the button (Hard, Good, Easy)[\[21\]](https://help.remnote.com/en/articles/6026144-the-anki-sm-2-spaced-repetition-algorithm#:~:text=The%20Interval%20Factor%20is%20then,and%201%20for%20Easily%20Recalled). The net effect is: being a little overdue doesn’t punish you; being hugely overdue and still remembering can even *increase* the intervals significantly (since clearly the card was easier than the algorithm thought). If you implement a bot, you might not need this complexity initially, but it’s a nice feature to consider: essentially, if actual\_review\_date \> scheduled\_due\_date and the user was correct, you could inflate the next interval a bit relative to the plan.

* **Advanced Algorithms (FSRS and Others):** The simplicity of SM-2 is part of its appeal – it was one reason Anki adopted it (even though SuperMemo itself has iterated through many versions up to SM-18)[\[28\]](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=34152100#:~:text=Most%20SRS%20algorithms%20seen%20in,in%20one%20shape%20or%20form). In recent years, there’s interest in more advanced, data-driven scheduling. Anki 2.1.55+ (as of late 2023\) introduced an optional algorithm called **FSRS** (Free Spaced Repetition Scheduler)[\[37\]](https://faqs.ankiweb.net/what-spaced-repetition-algorithm#:~:text=As%20of%20Anki%2023,second%20one%20is%20called%20FSRS). FSRS uses a machine-learning approach to optimize intervals, modeling each card’s **difficulty (D)** and **stability (S)** and aiming for a target recall probability (e.g. 90%)[\[38\]](https://faqs.ankiweb.net/what-spaced-repetition-algorithm#:~:text=FSRS%20aims%20to%20learn%20your,2)[\[39\]](https://faqs.ankiweb.net/what-spaced-repetition-algorithm#:~:text=,particular%20card%20drops%20to%2090). It analyzes your review history to fine-tune intervals beyond what a fixed formula can do[\[40\]](https://faqs.ankiweb.net/what-spaced-repetition-algorithm#:~:text=In%20FSRS%2C%20these%20three%20values,fit%20to%20the%20review%20history). In practice, FSRS can schedule even more efficiently than the default algorithm (users report needing fewer reviews for the same retention)[\[41\]](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=34152100#:~:text=SuperMemo%20is%20proprietary%20software%2C%20and,introduce%20more%20complexity%20are%20marginal%2Fquestionable). However, implementing FSRS is significantly more complex – it involves algorithms fitting and iterative calculations. As an open-source alternative to SuperMemo’s proprietary newer algorithms, FSRS shows roughly comparable performance to the latest SuperMemo (SM-17) in tests[\[42\]](https://faqs.ankiweb.net/what-spaced-repetition-algorithm#:~:text=The%20simple%20answer%20is%20that,17). If you’re after an “implementation-ready” logic, SM-2 (or Anki’s variant) is far easier to code and understand. But it’s good to know the cutting edge: some applications use neural networks or huge datasets to predict optimal intervals. For a personal project, sticking with a proven simple method like SM-2 or a slight tweak of it is usually best.

**Conclusion:** The SM-2 algorithm remains at the heart of spaced repetition due to its elegant simplicity and effectiveness. Anki’s scheduling system can be viewed as a set of pragmatic tweaks on SM-2 – separating the initial learning phase, simplifying user feedback to four buttons, and adding safeguards (ease floors, lapse handling options, etc.) to smooth out rough edges[\[43\]](https://faqs.ankiweb.net/what-spaced-repetition-algorithm#:~:text=Anki%E2%80%99s%20algorithm%20differs%20from%20SM,Notably)[\[44\]](https://faqs.ankiweb.net/what-spaced-repetition-algorithm#:~:text=%2A%20Like%20SM,instead%20of%20the%20same%20day). By understanding these mechanisms, you can implement a flashcard review logic that optimally schedules reminders for words. In code, this means maintaining per-item state (ease factor, current interval, etc.) and updating it according to the rules outlined above at each review. The result is a system that helps users **review items at just the right time** – not too early (which would waste time), and not too late (which would risk forgetting). This spaced repetition technique leverages our brain’s memory patterns to achieve excellent long-term retention with minimal effort[\[45\]](https://www.growthengineering.co.uk/spaced-repetition/#:~:text=There%20are%20numerous%20studies%20demonstrating,repetition%20significantly%20improves%20knowledge%20retention)[\[46\]](https://www.growthengineering.co.uk/spaced-repetition/#:~:text=,mean%20exam%20score%20of%2061). With an SM-2 based algorithm in your toolkit, your flashcard bot will ensure that learned words stay learned for the long haul, by scheduling timely reminders exactly when they’re needed.
